# TOO LAZY TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!
This project is as the repo title stated, a simple http server made in golang. Just compile it or run 
it using the usual command. Running the executable without any commands will print a summarize usage information.

The program accepts one main subcommand: `serve`. It's used to create a HTTP listener on the localhost port 80.
You can specify a `--address ADDRESS:PORT` argument to give the server an address and port of your choosing. The `ADDRESS` 
must be an IPv4 address or the alias `localhost` which will be expanded to the loopback address.

The server uses a JSON file-based database for its non-volatile storage mechanism. 
It will create a default file.json on the current directory for its runtime storage, 
and will insert one entry just for keep sake. The argument `--file JSON_PATH` can be specified to use a custom json file.

The server supports the following API:
- PUT /create-data - Creates data 
- GET /get-data    - Get the data
- POST /update-data - Updates the data
- DELETE /delete-data - Deletes the data
  
## API: PUT /create-data
The create endpoint accepts two query parameters: `name` and `value`. The `name` parameter defines the name of the entry, 
and it is **required**. The `value` parameter is optional, and if its not set, the entry value will be an empty string.

### Example creating an entry
Creates an entry named "b" with the value "hello"

![create1](https://github.com/CTRLRLTY/golang-simple-http-server/assets/52656050/0e3282e1-3ddb-4ba1-b8d9-62f605743e1b)

## API: GET /get-data
The get endpoint accepts two query parameters: `id` and `name`, but only one of them **must** be used at a time. You can get an 
entry by `id` or by `name`. Setting the `id` to `-1` will return all entries.

### Example of getting an entry by `name`
Retreive the entry named "b". Notice how a single entry is wrapped in a collection?

### Example of getting all entries
Retreive all entries. Both entry "b" and "a" is present on the response message.

## API: POST /update-data
The update endpoint accepts two query parameters: `name` and `value`. The `name` parameter specifies the target entry to modify,
and an optional `value` parameter specifies new value. No `value` means empty string.. same deal as create API :)

### Example of updating an entry by `name`
Sets the value of entry "b" to "goodbye"

![update1](https://github.com/CTRLRLTY/golang-simple-http-server/assets/52656050/9181d56b-c7bd-43b4-be19-6e3125f6b69c)

## API: DELETE /delete-data
The delete endpoint basically works like the get API, where you can either delete by `id` or `name`. Setting the `id` to -1 will 
delete all entries, setting it to null.

### Example of deleting all entries
Deletes all entry by setting `id=-1`

![delete1](https://github.com/CTRLRLTY/golang-simple-http-server/assets/52656050/6f80e490-da13-4034-9719-cab2a7a0e8ea)

## Response status 
The example pictures above contains all the expected succesful response status code for each API. Malformed queries will 
return a `400` response status. If for whatever reason when synchronizing/writing dirty runtime data into the JSON file failed, 
a response status of `500` will be returned.
